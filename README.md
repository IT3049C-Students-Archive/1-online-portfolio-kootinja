## Self-Reflection:
I learned in this assignment about the different wasy to use GitHub. I was able to be efficient with using the different HTML tags to complete the assignment. I struggled with running the project initially because of the npm install but I saw someone else had the same issue as me so I just read the thread on how to fix it in Microsoft Teams. I had some configure issues but that was becasue I coded my h2 tags wrong and fixed it as soon as I ran the debugger function. 

Overall: 20/20

### How long it took me to finish this?
1.5 hour
